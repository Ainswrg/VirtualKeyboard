# VirtualKeyboard
## [A link to deployed application is here](https://ainswrg.github.io/VirtualKeyboard/)
## Stack
   - JS
   - SASS
   - Webpack
## Functional:
   - All the necessary elements are generated with the usage of JS
   - Pressing a key on a physical keyboard highlights the key on the virtual keyboard
   - The virtual keyboard is able to switch between two language layouts (English + any other language).

      - the buttons on the virtual keyboard display symbols of a selected language
      - the application saves a chosen language after the page is reloaded and displays the keyboard on that language
  - Keystrokes are animated

  - Clicks on the buttons with a mouse on the virtual keyboard and pressing keys on a physical keyboard input symbols to the text area located on the page above the virtual keyboard.

      - pressing the Up, Down, Left or Right arrow key inputs an arrow symbol in the input field, or implements navigation on the text area.
      - pressing the Enter move a text cursor to the next line
      - the Tab key creates a horizontal indent
      - pressing the rest of the function keys on a keyboard does not result in inputting symbols
      - the Backspace key removes character before the text cursor
      - the Del key removes character after the text cursor
      - the Shift, Alt, Ctrl, Caps lock and Space keys work as on a real keyboard
